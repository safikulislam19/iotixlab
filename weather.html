                    <p class="text-start ">Groundwater quality is important not only for public health but also for the overall well-being of our 
                        communities and economies. Water contamination can cause long-term issues like lower property 
                        values, health problems, and economic challenges. In many rural areas, groundwater is the primary 
                        and affordable water source. Once contaminated, it is hard and costly to clean. That's why regular 
                        testing and monitoring are essential.</p>

                        <p class="text-start">
                            Groundwater is a primary source of drinking water for many people in rural and urban areas of 
Bangladesh. It also plays a vital role in agriculture, supporting farming activities that sustain local 
economies. Contaminated groundwater can have far-reaching consequences. Here’s why it’s 
important to focus on groundwater quality:
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-start">Groundwater contamination can occur due to various factors, including agricultural runoff, septic 
                            systems, industrial activities, and household chemical use. At IoTixLab, we recommend periodic 
                            testing for the following common contaminants: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="text-start"><b>Bacteria</b>: Total Coliforms and E. Coli indicate potential fecal contamination.</li>
                                <li class="text-start"><b>Nitrates</b>: From agricultural activities, septic systems, and waste disposal, nitrates can 
                                    contaminate groundwater. </li>
                                <li class="text-start"><b>Lead</b>: Often found in old plumbing systems. </li>
                                <li class="text-start"><b>Pesticides and Herbicides</b>: Agricultural runoff can introduce harmful chemicals into
